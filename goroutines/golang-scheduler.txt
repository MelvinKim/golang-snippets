Go scheduler
- Golang scheduler manages the thread pools for us.
- when a Golang program, starts up, it's given a logical processor that we call "P"
- data structures used:
  1. Global run queue
  2. Local run queue (every "P" has Local run queue)

a goroutines can be in any of the following states:
1. running | executing
2. runnable
3. waiting
